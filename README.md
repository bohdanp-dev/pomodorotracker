# React Pomodoro Timer üçÖ

This React-based Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool designed to enhance focus and efficiency. It features Pomodoro and break modes with customizable timers, coupled with a basic to-do list. The app is styled using CSS Modules and is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. Deployed on Vercel, this project is a showcase of my skills in building functional and user-friendly web applications.

## Features üåü

- **Pomodoro Technique**: Implements the Pomodoro technique to boost productivity.
- **Customizable Timers**: Users can set their own intervals for Pomodoro and break periods.
- **To-Do List**: Includes a basic to-do list to track tasks.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts seamlessly to different devices, ensuring a consistent user experience on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- **CSS Modules**: Styling is done using CSS Modules for scoped and maintainable styles.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel for easy and reliable access.

## Built With üî®

- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **CSS Modules**: For component-scoped styling.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: Platform for deployment and hosting.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
